BUILDING
========

Change into the src/ directory and run the makefile.


CONTROLS
========

The hosting application controls the left player, and the joining application
the right player. The left and right arrow keys move the character side to
side. The 'A' key performs a light attack. The 'S' key performs a heavy attack.
 The escape key returns you to the main menu.


KNOWN ISSUES
============

Occasionally the client fails to properly sync with the server due to some sort
of race condition. Exiting out the main menu and joining again resolves this
in essentially every case.

Due to time contraints, character selection had to be dropped.

The "Join" command connects to a server at 127.0.0.1.
